  %p.lead
    The Applied Networking Research Workshop (ANRW) provides a forum for
    researchers, vendors, network operators and the Internet standards community
    to present and discuss emerging results in applied networking research.

  %p
    In order to foster this cross-community collaboration, the workshops will be
    co-located with IETF standards meetings once a year (typically in the
    summer), and will be organized in a way that allows ample time for
    discussion and interaction, and not just paper presentations.
