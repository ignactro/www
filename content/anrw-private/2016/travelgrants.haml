%h1 Student Travel Grants

%p
  The ANRW organizers are trying to provide as much support to as many student
  attendees as possible. Travel grants are available to students
  %em currently enrolled
  in Bachelor, Masters or PhD programs at any university.

%p
  Travel grant awards are meant to
  %em partially
  cover the cost of attending and participating in the workshop. The only travel
  expenses that can be reimbursed are:

%ul
  %li economy airfare or rail tickets
  %li hotel
  %li workshop registration

%p
  The award recipients will need to pay for the expenses ahead of time and get
  reimbursed after the workshop. The exact number of awards will depend on the
  availability of funds and will be determined as funding amounts are finalized.


%h2 Selection Criteria

%p The following criteria will be used in the selection process:

%ul
  %li
    Preference will be given to applicants that do
    %em not
    present a paper at the workshop. The rationale is that the participation
    costs for a presenting author should be covered by their home institution.
  %li
    Evidence of a serious interest in applied networking, as demonstrated by
    coursework and/or project experience, is required. Advanced students
    close to graduation will also be given priority, when possible, in order
    to aid their job search.
  %li
    We strongly encourage participation of women and under-represented
    minorities.
  %li
    After giving priority to the above criteria, (co-)authors of papers may be
    considered but will be given lower priority. The rationale is to support
    people that contribute to the workshop but could not attend otherwise, e.g.,
    due to budget or other constraints. The applicant should explain why it is
    impossible to support the applicant from other sources.


%h2 Where and How to Apply

%p
  All application materials (applicant's info, CV, and letters) should be
  submitted electronically to the following website:
  XXX

%p
  The applicant should create an account in the submission system and upload:

%ul
  %li an application letter
  %li an up-to-date CV
  %li a support letter from their faculty advisor

%p
  The applicant's letter should be clearly divided in the following sections:

%ul
  %li
    an explicit identification of the applicant's university and country of
    study (e.g., URL to the department's home page, etc.)
  %li an explicit identification of the applicant's faculty advisor
  %li a brief summary of research interests and plans for future research
  %li why the workshop attendance is important to the applicant's research
  %li
    a cost estimate of the trip, including the cost of economy air or rail fare,
    hotel (identify the source of any price quote)
  %li
    any additional information the applicant feels is relevant to support
    their case

%p The advisor's letter should be clearly divided in the following sections:

%ul
  %li verification of the applicant's good standing in the institution
  %li
    explain why the applicant would benefit from attending the workshop and how
    he/she could contribute to the workshop
  %li

    travel grant

%p.text-danger
  Advisor letters should be uploaded directly into the applicant's account. We
  suggest that the applicant provide their login information to the advisor to
  do so. The submission site has been designed to keep advisor letters
  "write-only", i.e., the applicant will not be able to view the uploaded letter
  in their account.
