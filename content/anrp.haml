  %h2 2014 Prize Winners for IETF-89

  %p
    We are extremely pleased to report that for the 2014 award period of the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP), 46 eligible nominations were received. Each submission was reviewed by four members of the
    %a{ :href => "#committee" } selection committee
    according to a diverse set of criteria, including scientific excellence and substance, timeliness, relevance, and potential impact on the Internet.

  %p
    Based on this review, six submissions were awarded an Applied Networking Research Prize for 2014. The first two prize winners will present their work at IETF-89 in London, UK. The ANRP awards for IETF-89 go to:

%h2 About the ANRP

%p
  The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is awarded for recent results in applied networking research that are relevant for transitioning into shipping Internet products and related standardization efforts. Researchers with relevant, recent results are encouraged to apply for this prize, which will offer them the opportunity to present and discuss their work with the engineers, network operators, policy makers and scientists that participate in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its research arm, the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).
  %span.term Third-party nominations for this prize are also encouraged.
  The goal of the Applied Networking Research Prize is to recognize the best new ideas in networking, and bring them to the IETF and IRTF especially in cases where they would not otherwise see much exposure or discussion.

%p The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) consists of:
%ul
  %li
    %span.term cash prize
    of $500 (USD)
  %li
    %span.term invited talk
    at the IRTF Open Meeting
  %li
    %span.term travel grant
    to attend a week-long IETF meeting (airfare, hotel, registration, stipend)
  %li
    recognition at the
    %span.term IETF plenary
  %li
    invitation to related
    %span.term social activities
  %li
    potential for
    %span.term additional travel grants
    to future IETF meetings, based on community feedback

%p
  The Applied Networking Research Prize will be awarded
  %span.term once per calendar year.
  Each year,
  %span.term several winners
  will be chosen and invited to present their work at one of the three IETF meetings during the year.


%h2 How to Nominate

%p
  Only a
  %span.term single
  person can be nominated for the award. The basis of the nomination is a peer-reviewed, original journal, conference or workshop paper they authored, which was recently published or accepted for publication. The nominee
  %span.term must
  be one of the main authors of the nominated paper. Both self nominations (nominating one's own paper) and third-party nominations (nominating someone else's paper) are encouraged.

%p The nominated paper should provide a scientific foundation for possible future IETF engineering work or IRTF research and experimentation, analyze the behavior of Internet protocols in operational deployments or realistic testbeds, make an important contribution to the understanding of Internet scalability, performance, reliability, security or capability, or otherwise be of relevance to ongoing or future IETF or IRTF activities.

%p Applicants must briefly describe how the nominated paper relates to these goals, and are encouraged to describe how a presentation of these research results would foster their transition into new IETF engineering or IRTF experimentation, or otherwise seed new activities that will have an impact on the real-world Internet.

%p The goal of the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is to foster the transitioning of research results into real-world benefits for the Internet. Therefore, applicants must indicate that they (or the nominee, in case of third-party nominations) are available to attend at least one of the year's IETF meetings in person and in its entirety.

-# %p Nominations must include:
-# %ul
-#   %li
-#     the
-#     %span.term name
-#     and
-#     %span.term email address
-#     of the nominee
-#   %li
-#     a bibliographic
-#     %span.term reference
-#     to the published (or accepted) nominated paper
-#   %li
-#     a
-#     %span.term PDF copy
-#     of the nominated paper
-#   %li
-#     a
-#     %span.term statement
-#     that describes how the nominated paper fulfills the goals of the award
-#   %li
-#     a
-#     %span.term statement
-#     about which of the year's IETF meetings the nominee would be available to attend in person and in its entirety
-#   %li
-#     a brief
-#     %span.term biography
-#     or
-#     %span.term CV
-#     of the nominee
-#   %li optionally, any other supporting information (link to nominee's web site, etc.)
-#
-# %p
-#   Nominations are submitted via the
-#   = link_to("submission site", "anrp/2014") + "."
-#   In exceptional cases, nominations may also be submitted by email to
-#   = link_to("anrp@irtf.org", "mail:anrp@irtf.org") + "."
-#
-# %p All nominees will be notified by email about the decision regarding their nomination.

%p
  Nominations for the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) are
  %span.term not
  considered to be contributions to the IETF. However, the invited talks at the IRTF Open Meeting
  %span.term are
  considered to be contributions, and the IRTF
  %a{ :href => "/ipr"} "Intellectual Property Rights" statement
  does apply to them.

%h2 Selection Process
