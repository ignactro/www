  %h2 Prize Winners
  
  %p
    We are extremely pleased to report that for this very first award of the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP), 24 nominations were received. Each submission was reviewed by 2-4 members of the
    %a{ :href => "#committee" } selection committee
    according to a diverse set of criteria, including scientific excellence and substance, timeliness, relevance, and potential impact on the Internet.
  
  %p Based on this review, two submissions were awarded an Applied Networking Research Prize:

%h2 Future Calls for Nominations

%p There will be a call for nominations this summer that will target IETF-82 in Taipei, Taiwan in November 2011. For 2012, we are considering to switch to a yearly nomination/award cycle, with a call for nominations in late 2011 that will cover all three IETF meetings planned for 2012.

%p
  Please subscribe to the
  %a{ :href => "/mailman/listinfo/irtf-announce" } IRTF-Announce mailing list
  in order to receive future calls for ANRP nominations and

%h2 About the ANRP
 
%p The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is awarded for recent results in applied networking research that are relevant for transitioning into shipping Internet products and related standardization efforts. Researchers with relevant, recently published results are encouraged to apply for this prize, which will offer them the opportunity to present and discuss their work with the engineers, network operators, policy makers and scientists that participate in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its research arm, the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). Third-party nominations for this prize are also encouraged. The goal of the Applied Networking Research Prize is to recognize the best new ideas in networking, and bring them to the IETF and IRTF especially in cases where they would not otherwise see much exposure or discussion.
 
%p The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) consists of:
%ul
  %li
    %span.term cash prize
    of $500 (USD)
  %li
    %span.term invited talk
    at the IRTF Open Meeting
  %li
    %span.term travel grant
    to attend the week-long IETF meeting (airfare, hotel, registration, stipend)
  %li
    recognition at the
    %span.term IETF plenary
  %li
    invitation to related
    %span.term social activities
  %li
    potential for
    %span.term additional travel grants
    to future IETF meetings, based on community feedback

%p The Applied Networking Research Prize will be awarded three times per year, in conjunction with the three annual IETF meetings.

 
%h2 How to Apply
 
%p Applicants must nominate a peer-reviewed, recently-published, original journal, conference or workshop paper. Both self nominations (nominating one's own paper) and third-party nominations (nominating someone else's paper) are encouraged. The nominee must be one of the main authors of the nominated paper.
 
%p The nominated paper should provide a scientific foundation for possible future IETF engineering work or IRTF experimentation, analyze the behavior of Internet protocols in operational deployments or realistic testbeds, make an important contribution to the understanding of Internet scalability, performance, reliability, security or capability, or otherwise be of relevance to ongoing or future IETF or IRTF activities.
 
%p Applicants must briefly describe how the nominated paper relates to these goals, and are encouraged to describe how presentation of these research results will foster their transition into new IETF engineering or IRTF experimentation, or otherwise seed new activities that will have an impact on the real-world Internet.
 
%p The goal of the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is to foster the transitioning of research results into real-world benefits for the Internet. Therefore, applicants must indicate that they (or the nominee, in case of third-party applications) are available to attend the respective IETF meeting in person and in its entirety.
 
%p Applications must include:
%ul
  %li
    the
    %span.term name
    and
    %span.term email address
    of the nominee
  %li
    a
    %span.term reference
    to the published nominated paper
  %li
    a
    %span.term PDF copy
    of the nominated paper
  %li
    a
    %span.term statement
    that describes how the nominated paper fulfills the goals of the award
  %li
    a
    %span.term statement
    that the nominee is available to attend the respective IETF meeting in person and in its entirety
  %li
    a brief
    %span.term biography
    or
    %span.term
    CV of the nominee
  %li optionally, any other supporting information (link to nominee's web site, etc.)
