-# 		%p
-# 			We are extremely pleased to report that for the 2015 award period of
-# 			the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP), 33 eligible nominations
-# 			were received. Each submission was reviewed by 3-5 members of the
-# 			%a{ :href => "#committee" } selection committee
-# 			selection committee according to a diverse set of criteria, including
-# 			scientific excellence and substance, timeliness, relevance, and
-# 			potential impact on the Internet.

-# 		%p
-# 			Based on this review, five submissions are awarded an Applied
-# 			Networking Research Prize in 2015. Two prize winners will present
-# 			their work at the IRTF Open Meeting during IETF-94 in Yokohama,
-# 			Japan. The ANRPs for IETF-94 go to:

	%h2 About the ANRP

	%p
		The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is awarded for recent results in applied networking research that are relevant for transitioning into shipping Internet products and related standardization efforts. Researchers with relevant, recent results are encouraged to apply for this prize, which will offer them the opportunity to present and discuss their work with the engineers, network operators, policy makers and scientists that participate in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its research arm, the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).
		%em Third-party nominations for this prize are also encouraged.
		The goal of the Applied Networking Research Prize is to recognize the best new ideas in networking, and bring them to the IETF and IRTF especially in cases where they would not otherwise see much exposure or discussion.

	%p The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) consists of:
	%ul
		%li
			%em cash prize
			of $500 (USD)
		%li
			%em invited talk
			at the IRTF Open Meeting
		%li
			%em travel grant
			to attend a week-long IETF meeting (airfare, hotel, registration, stipend)
		%li
			recognition at the
			%em IETF plenary
		%li
			invitation to related
			%em social activities
		%li
			potential for
			%em additional travel grants
			to future IETF meetings, based on community feedback

	%p
		The Applied Networking Research Prize will be awarded
		%em once per calendar year.
		Each year,
		%em several winners
		will be chosen and invited to present their work at one of the three IETF meetings during the year.


	%h2 How to Nominate

	%p
		Only a
		%em single
		person can be nominated for the award. The basis of the nomination is a peer-reviewed, original journal, conference or workshop paper they authored, which was recently published or accepted for publication. The nominee
		%em must
		be one of the main authors of the nominated paper. Both self nominations (nominating one's own paper) and third-party nominations (nominating someone else's paper) are encouraged.

	%p The nominated paper should provide a scientific foundation for possible future IETF engineering work or IRTF research and experimentation, analyze the behavior of Internet protocols in operational deployments or realistic testbeds, make an important contribution to the understanding of Internet scalability, performance, reliability, security or capability, or otherwise be of relevance to ongoing or future IETF or IRTF activities.

	%p Applicants must briefly describe how the nominated paper relates to these goals, and are encouraged to describe how a presentation of these research results would foster their transition into new IETF engineering or IRTF experimentation, or otherwise seed new activities that will have an impact on the real-world Internet.

	%p The goal of the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is to foster the transitioning of research results into real-world benefits for the Internet. Therefore, applicants must indicate that they (or the nominee, in case of third-party nominations) are available to attend at least one of the year's IETF meetings in person and in its entirety.

	%p Nominations must include:
	%ul
		%li
			the
			%em name
			and
			%em email address
			of the nominee
		%li
			a bibliographic
			%em reference
			to the published (or accepted) nominated paper
		%li
			a
			%em PDF copy
			of the nominated paper
		%li
			a
			%em statement
			that describes how the nominated paper fulfills the goals of the award
		%li
			a
			%em statement
			about which of the year's IETF meetings the nominee would be available to attend in person and in its entirety
		%li
			a brief
			%em biography
			or
			%em CV
			of the nominee
		%li optionally, any other supporting information (link to nominee's web site, etc.)

	%p
		Nominations are submitted via the
		= link_to("submission site", "anrp/2016") + "."
		In exceptional cases, nominations may also be submitted by email to
		= link_to("anrp@irtf.org", "mailto:anrp@irtf.org") + "."

	%p All nominees will be notified by email about the decision regarding their nomination.

	%p
		Nominations for the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) are
		%em not
		considered to be contributions to the IETF. However, the invited talks at the IRTF Open Meeting
		%em are
		considered to be contributions, and the IRTF
		%a{ :href => "/ipr"} "Intellectual Property Rights" statement
		does apply to them.
