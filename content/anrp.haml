-#    %p
-#      The nomination period for the
-#      %a{ :href => "anrp"} Applied Networking Research Prize
-#      for IETF-81, July 24-29, 2011 in Quebec City, Canada has ended.
     
-#    %p No nominations are currently accepted. The next nomination period will start after IETF-81.

-#  
-#  %p
-#    The ANRP selection committee has decided to move from a nomination/selection cycle per IETF meeting to a
-#    %em yearly
-#    nomination/selection cycle covering all of a year's IETF meetings. This change will not affect the number of ANRPs awarded (roughly one award per IETF meeting) and awardees can state a preference as to which IETF meeting during a given year they'd like to present at.
-#  
-#  %p The nomination/selection cycle for a given year will occur during the fall of the previous year, ending before the winter holiday period. This means that for 2013, the nomination/selection cycle will occur during the fall of 2012, covering all three IETF meetings in 2013.
-#  
-#  %p Consequently, the nomination/award schedule for 2012 will be adjusted as follows:
-#  
-#  %ul
-#    %li No ANRPs will be awarded for IETF-83 in Paris, due to the holiday season and short time since the last IETF meeting.
-#  
-#    %li A nomination/selection cycle to pick awardees for the two remaining IETF meetings in 2012 (IETF-84 in Vancouver and IETF-85 in Atlanta) will be held before IETF-84.
-#  
-#  %p
-#    The call-for-nominations for the 2012 selection cycle will be announced on the 
-#    %a{ :href => "/mailman/listinfo/irtf-announce" } IRTF announcement mailing list
-#    during the spring of 2012.

%h2 About the ANRP
 
%p The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is awarded for recent results in applied networking research that are relevant for transitioning into shipping Internet products and related standardization efforts. Researchers with relevant, recently published results are encouraged to apply for this prize, which will offer them the opportunity to present and discuss their work with the engineers, network operators, policy makers and scientists that participate in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its research arm, the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). Third-party nominations for this prize are also encouraged. The goal of the Applied Networking Research Prize is to recognize the best new ideas in networking, and bring them to the IETF and IRTF especially in cases where they would not otherwise see much exposure or discussion.
 
%p The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) consists of:
%ul
  %li
    %span.term cash prize
    of $500 (USD)
  %li
    %span.term invited talk
    at the IRTF Open Meeting
  %li
    %span.term travel grant
    to attend a week-long IETF meeting (airfare, hotel, registration, stipend)
  %li
    recognition at the
    %span.term IETF plenary
  %li
    invitation to related
    %span.term social activities
  %li
    potential for
    %span.term additional travel grants
    to future IETF meetings, based on community feedback

%p The Applied Networking Research Prize will be awarded once per calendar year. Each year, several winners will be chosen and invited to present their work at one of the three IETF meetings during the year. 

 
%h2 How to Nominate
 
%p Only a single person can be nominated for the award. The basis of the nomination is a peer-reviewed, recently-published, original journal, conference or workshop paper they authored. The nominee must be one of the main authors of the nominated paper. Both self nominations (nominating one's own paper) and third-party nominations (nominating someone else's paper) are encouraged. 
 
%p The nominated paper should provide a scientific foundation for possible future IETF engineering work or IRTF research and experimentation, analyze the behavior of Internet protocols in operational deployments or realistic testbeds, make an important contribution to the understanding of Internet scalability, performance, reliability, security or capability, or otherwise be of relevance to ongoing or future IETF or IRTF activities.
 
%p Applicants must briefly describe how the nominated paper relates to these goals, and are encouraged to describe how a presentation of these research results would foster their transition into new IETF engineering or IRTF experimentation, or otherwise seed new activities that will have an impact on the real-world Internet.
 
%p The goal of the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is to foster the transitioning of research results into real-world benefits for the Internet. Therefore, applicants must indicate that they (or the nominee, in case of third-party nominations) are available to attend the respective IETF meeting in person and in its entirety.
 
%p Nominations must include:
%ul
  %li
    the
    %span.term name
    and
    %span.term email address
    of the nominee
  %li
    a bibliographic 
    %span.term reference
    to the published nominated paper
  %li
    a
    %span.term PDF copy
    of the nominated paper
  %li
    a
    %span.term statement
    that describes how the nominated paper fulfills the goals of the award
  %li
    a
    %span.term statement
    about which of the year's IETF meetings the nominee would be available to attend in person and in its entirety
  %li
    a brief
    %span.term biography
    or
    %span.term
    CV of the nominee
  %li optionally, any other supporting information (link to nominee's web site, etc.)
  
%p
  Nominations are submitted via the
  = link_to("submission site", "anrp/2012") + "." 
  In exceptional cases, nominations may also be submitted by email to 
  = link_to("anrp@irtf.org", "mail:anrp@irtf.org") + "."
  
%p All nominees will be notified by email about the decision regarding their nomination.

%p

  %span.term not
  considered to be contributions to the IETF. However, the invited talks at the IRTF Open Meeting
  %span.term are
