%p
  The ACM, IRTF & ISOC Applied Networking Research Workshop 2019 (ANRW’19) is an academic workshop that provides a forum for researchers, vendors, network operators, and the Internet standards community to present and discuss emerging results in applied networking research. Our other goal is to create a path for <strong>academics to transition research back into the IETF standards and protocols</strong> and for academics to find inspiration from topics and open problems addressed at the IETF.

%p
  <strong>We are particularly interested in topics that focus on wide-area networks and network security</strong>, but applied networking topics outside of these focus areas are also welcome.
