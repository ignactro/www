Obviously, middleboxes impede path transparency,\r\ni.e., the idea that an exchange of messages results in more or less\r\nthe same packets, no matter what path the packets take. \r\n \r\nBut no one seems to have a truly global view of what middleboxes do\r\nto packets on what Internet paths, which would however be essential\r\nknowledge for new transport protocols to be successfully deployed.\r\n\r\nWe address these concerns in the MAMI project by building an\r\nobservatory of path transparency measurements.  The project hosts an\r\nextensive set of path transparency measure\\-ments---we believe it to\r\nbe the first dataset to deal specifically with middlebox\r\ninvolvement.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we describe that Observatory and a number of questions\r\nthat we want to address with the data in that Observatory.\r\n\r\nEventually, the project will provide public access to that\r\nObservatory so that researchers and the interested public can ask\r\ntheir own questions about path transparency issues and middlebox\r\ninvolvement.",

        "abstract": "Multipath TCP has been recently introduced in order to allow a better resource consumption and user quality-of-experience.  This is achieved by allowing a connection between two hosts through multiple subflows.  However, with the rise of middleboxes and inherent Internet ossification, the large-scale deployment of this TCP extension is difficult.  In particular, a load balancer at the entry point of a data center may forward subflows to different servers, cancelling so the advantages of Multipath TCP.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce MpLb, a Multipath TCP aware load balancer that fixes this particular issue without any modification to the Multipath TCP protocol itself.  We demonstrate advantages of MpLb through a proof-of-concept.",

Nowadays, to make use of RSes, these policies must be disclosed to the IXP.\r\nThis state of affairs raises privacy concerns among network administrators and even deters some networks from subscribing to RS services. We design SIXPACK (which stands for \"Securing Internet eXchange Points Against Curious onlooKers\"), a RS service that leverages Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) techniques to keep export policies confidential, while maintaining the same functionalities as today's RSes. We assess the effectiveness and scalability of our system by evaluating our prototype implementation and using traces of data from one of the largest IXPs in the world.",

        "abstract": "The IETF has developed protocols that promote a healthy IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence. The Happy Eyeballs (HE) algorithm, for instance, prevents bad user experience in situations where IPv6 connectivity is broken. Using an active test (happy) that measures TCP connection establishment times, we evaluate the effects of the HE algorithm. The happy test measures against ALEXA top 10K websites from 80 SamKnows probes connected to dual-stacked networks representing 58 different ASes. Using a 3-years long (2013 - 2016) dataset, we show that TCP connect times to popular websites over IPv6 have considerably improved over time. As of Feb 2016, 15% of these websites are faster over IPv6 with 88% of the rest at most 1 ms slower. The historical trend shows that only around 1% of the TCP connect times over IPv6 were ever above the HE timer value (300 ms), which leaves around 2% chance for IPv4 to win a HE race towards these websites. As such, 99% of these web- sites prefer IPv6 connections more than 98% of the time. We show that although absolute TCP connect times (in ms) are not that far apart in both address families, HE with a 300 ms timer value tends to prefer slower IPv6 connections in around 90% of the cases. We show that lowering the HE timer value to 150 ms gives us a margin benefit of 10% while retaining same preference levels over IPv6.",

        "abstract": "In today’s Internet we see an increasing deployment of middleboxes. While middleboxes provide in-network functionality that is necessary to keep networks manageable and economically viable, any packet mangling – whether essential for the needed functionality or accidental as an unwanted side effect – makes it more and more difficult to deploy new protocols or extensions of existing protocols. For the evolution of the protocol stack, it is important to know which network impairments exist and potentially need to be worked around. While classical network measurement tools are often focused on absolute performance values, we present a new measurement tool, called PATHspider that performs A\/B testing between two different protocols or different protocol extension to perform controlled experiments of protocol-dependent connectivity problems as well as differential treatment. PATHspider is a framework for performing and analyzing these measurements, while the actual A\/B test can be easily customized. This paper describes the basic design approach and architecture of PATHspider and gives guidance how to use and customize it.",

        "abstract": "Google congestion control (GCC) has been proposed for the case of delay sensitive traffic (i.e. video-conference) in the WebRTC framework. In this paper we analyze the effect of wireless channel outages on the GCC. We have observed that, when a channel outage ends, there are packets that arrive at the receiver as a burst. This behavior impairs the delay-based controller employed by GCC, resulting in throughput degradation. We propose a solution to make GCC robust wrt channel outages. In particular, by grouping packets that arrive in a burst, the delay-based controller avoids to misinterpret a burst as network congestion. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed  solution we have carried out a trace-driven experimental evaluation in a loaded Wi-Fi scenario.",

        "abstract": "Updating data plane state to adapt to dynamic conditions is a fundamental network control operation. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) offers abstractions for updating network state while preserving consistency properties. However, realizing these abstractions in a purely centralized fashion is inefficient, due to the inherent delays between switches and the SDN controller, we argue for delegating the responsibility of coordinated updates to the switches. To make our case, we propose ez-Segway, a mechanism that enables decentralized network updates while preventing forwarding anomalies and avoiding link congestion. In our architecture, the controller is only responsible for computing the intended network configuration. This information is distributed to the switches, which use partial knowledge and direct message passing to efficiently schedule and implement the update. This separation of concerns has the key benefit of improving update performance as the communication and computation bottlenecks at the controller are removed. Our extensive simulations show update speedups up to a factor of 2.",

It was designed as an incrementally deployable evolution of TCP. For this reason, the Multipath TCP specification assumes that applications use the unmodified socket interface. Given the growing interest in using Multipath TCP for specific applications, there is a demand for an advanced API that enables application developers to control the operation of the Multipath TCP stack. Keeping with the incremental deployment objectives of Multipath TCP, we propose a simple but powerful socket API that uses new socket options to control the operation of the underlying stack. We implement this extension in the reference implemen- tation of Multipath TCP in the Linux kernel and illustrate its usefulness in several use cases.",

        "abstract": "Small companies and branch offices often have bandwidth demands and redundancy needs that exceed the commercially available Internet access products in their price range. One way to overcome this problem is to bundle existing Internet access products. In effect, they become multi-homed often without running BGP or even getting an AS number.\r\nRather, they rely on proprietary L4 load balancing routers, proprietary multi-channel VPN routers, or sometimes LISP, to bundle their “cheaper” Internet access network links, e.g., via (v)DSL, DOCSIS, HSDPA, or LTE. While most products claim transport-layer transparency they add complexity via middleboxes, map each TCP connection to a single interface, and have limited application support. Thus, in this paper we propose an alternative: Auto-configuration of multiple IPv6 prefixes on a single L2 link. We then discuss how this enables applications to take advantage of multiple access networks at the same time with minimal system changes.",

Ossification prevents the deployment of novel protocols, restricting solutions to protocols using either TCP or UDP as a substrate. We describe the transport services required by real-time applications. We show that, in the short term (i.e., while UDP is blocked at current levels), TCP offers a feasible substrate for providing these services. Over the longer term, protocols using UDP may reduce the number of networks blocking UDP, enabling a shift towards its use as a demultiplexing layer for novel transport protocols.",

        "abstract": "Concerns have been raised in the past several years that introducing new transport protocols on the Internet has become increasingly difficult, not least because there is no agreed-upon way for a source end host to find out if a transport protocol is supported all the way to a destination peer. A solution to a similar problem---finding out support for IPv6---has been proposed and is currently being deployed: the Happy Eyeballs (HE) mechanism. HE has also been proposed as an efficient way for an application to select an appropriate transport protocol. Still, there are few, if any, performance evaluations of transport HE. This paper demonstrates that transport HE could indeed be a feasible solution to the transport support problem. The paper evaluates HE between TCP and SCTP using TLS encrypted and unencrypted traffic, and shows that although there is indeed a cost in terms of CPU load to introduce HE, the cost is relatively small, especially in comparison with the cost of using TLS encryption. Moreover, our results suggest that HE has a marginal impact on memory usage. Finally, by introducing caching of previous connection attempts, the additional cost of transport HE could be significantly reduced.",

        "abstract": "When multiple TCP connections are used between the same host pair, they often share a common bottleneck -- especially when they are encapsulated together, e.g. in VPN scenarios. Then, all connections after the first should not have to guess the right initial value for the congestion window, but rather get the appropriate value from other connections. This allows short flows to complete much faster -- but it can also lead to large bursts that cause problems on their own. Prior work used timer-based pacing methods to alleviate this problem; we introduce a new algorithm that ``paces'' packets by instead correctly maintaining the ACK clock, and show its positive impact in combination with a previously presented congestion coupling algorithm.",
