%p
  The Applied Networking Research Workshop (ANRW) provides a forum for
  researchers, vendors, network operators and the Internet standards community
  to present and discuss emerging results in applied networking research.

%p
  Researchers should consider submitting
  early emerging results that illustrate the scientific and engineering
  principles underlying the Internet architecture, protocols and applications;
  that demonstrate new capabilities, features, or extensions to the Internet
  protocol layers; that enhance our understanding of how Internet protocols work
  in real-world deployments or realistic testbeds; or that improve Internet
  security and privacy, scalability, performance, and robustness.
