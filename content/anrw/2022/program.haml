        %p
          How should we describe and specify protocols? 

        %p
          How can we ensure that network protocol specifications are consistent
          and correct, and how can we verify that specifications are correct and
          validate that implementations match the specification?

        %p
          The IETF community has long used natural language, English, to describe
          and specify its protocols, mixed with occasional formal languages such
          as ABNF, YANG, and so on. This session will discuss whether this is the
          right approach, and to what extent formal methods, structured specification
          languages, and natural language processing techniques can help describe
          network protocols.

                  Automated Attack Synthesis by Extracting Finite State Machines from Protocol Specification Documents

                Automated attack discovery techniques, such as attacker synthesis
                or model-based fuzzing, provide powerful ways to ensure network
                protocols operate correctly and securely.  For RFC authors, these
                techniques can help assure that a protocol design is correct
                (devoid of bugs) and that its textual specification is
                unambiguous.  But such techniques, in general, require a formal
                representation of the protocol, often in the form of a finite
                state machine (FSM). Unfortunately, RFCs are written in English
                prose, and implementing even a simple network protocol as an FSM
                is time-consuming and prone to subtle logical errors.
                Automatically extracting protocol FSMs from documentation can
                significantly contribute to increased use of these techniques and
                result in more robust and secure protocol implementations.

              %p
                In this work we focus on attacker synthesis as a representative
                technique for assuring the security of protocols described by RFC
                documents. Unlike other works that rely on rule-based approaches
                or use off-the-shelf NLP tools directly, we suggest a data-driven
                approach for extracting FSMs from RFCs. Specifically, we use a
                hybrid approach consisting of three key steps: (1) large-scale
                word-representation learning for technical language, (2) focused
                zero-shot learning for mapping protocol text to a
                protocol-independent information language, and (3) rule-based
                mapping from protocol-independent information to a specific
                protocol FSM. We show the generalizability of our FSM extraction
                by using the RFCs for six different protocols: BGPv4, DCCP, LTP,
                PPTP, SCTP and TCP. We demonstrate how automated extraction of an
                FSM from an RFC can be applied to the synthesis of attacks, with
                TCP and DCCP as case-studies. Our approach shows how automated
                attack synthesis can help RFC authors design bug-free protocols
                and write unambiguous specifications.

                  Tools for disambiguating RFCs

              %p
                To date, working groups and specification authors have been
                making significant effort in maintaining the quality of
                specifications. In particular, ambiguities are undesirable and
                critical to protocol implementation. While the guidelines of
                specification production are more complete over time to reduce
                the chances of uncertainty in specifications, it remains a
                question whether the networking community is achieving a near zero
                ambiguity specification. In this talk, we will cover our work
                which discovers ambiguous instances and under-specified instances
                in long-standing protocol and discuss what extended work could be
                explored and what ongoing study is exploring.
