  Call for Papers

%p
  The ACM/IRTF Applied Networking Research Workshop 2022 (ANRW’22),
  co-located with IETF-114,  is the seventh edition of an academic workshop
  that provides a forum for researchers, vendors, network operators, and
  the Internet standards community to present and discuss emerging results
  in applied networking research.

%p
  The workshop combines presentations of new research in the form of short
  papers and lightning papers. ANRW'22 accepts the following types of
  submissions:

%ul
  %li
    %strong Short papers 
    are publications that present new research that has not been previously
    published. For a short paper to be considered for publication, please
    submit work describing early/emerging results in a relevant topic area.
    There is a 6-page limit for short papers, including figures, tables,
    and any appendices, optionally followed by unlimited additional pages
    for references.

  %li
    %strong Lightning papers 
    can provide a summary of early, emerging, or on-going work as well as
    short updates of previously published work. This type of submission
    will be presented in a short, lightning-talk style. For a lightning
    paper to be considered for presentation, please submit an extended
    abstract that is no longer than 2 pages, with a maximum of one
    additional page for references only.
    

%p
  Paper topics should be relevant to the standardization activities of
  related IETF working groups or activity in related IRTF research groups.
  
%p
  We note that the structure and use of the Internet, and Internet
  services, are evolving in ways that would have been difficult to
  anticipate two years ago. The list is long, including but not limited to
  shifts in traffic patterns and demands with remote work over broadband
  access networks, operational responses to large-scale physical and
  socio-political events, also trends towards increased multiplexing of
  connections over fewer IP addresses for various reasons that include
  scale, adaptability, and privacy.
  
%ul
  %li
    Development and deployment experience of new or enhanced Internet
    protocols (e.g., for transport, security, or routing).

  %li
    Improvements, measurements, and analysis of the security and privacy of
    new and existing Internet protocols and privacy enhancing technologies.

  %li
    Evolution of interconnection, and new approaches on network management,
    operations, and control.

  %li
    Practical congestion control for heterogeneous networks and novel
    applications.

  %li
    Better ways of specifying protocols, including usable techniques for
    protocol verification.

  %li
    Interactions between CDNs, anycast, and edge services such as DNS and
    Firewalls.

  %li
    Research and analysis of consolidation and centralization of the Internet.

  %li
    Techniques for logging/monitoring of Internet traffic and root-cause
    analysis, as well as debugging of (encrypted) Internet protocols.

  %li
    Measurement and analysis of the performance of networks, including the
    performance or quality of experience of networked applications.

  %li
    Design, measurement, analysis, or deployment of wireless, mobile, and
    cellular networks.

  %li
    Internet resilience and recovery in physically challenging environments
    and events (e.g., remote areas, natural disaster situations).

  %li
    Approaches and efforts towards decentralizing and democratizing the
    Internet.

  %li
    Understanding the impact and interoperability of diverse clients (e.g.,
    IoT, robotics, manufacturing).

  %li
    The changing semantics of IP addresses and connection-level metadata at
    large-scale (e.g. Addressing Agility, Private Relay).

  %li
    Topics relevant to the standardization activities of related IETF
    working groups.

  %li
    Topics relevant to activity in related IRTF research groups.

%p
  ANRW'22 is co-located with IETF-114, and takes place on July 23-29, 2022.
  This gives IETF as well as workshop attendees the opportunity to exchange
  ideas on topics and open problems discussed at the workshop and the IETF.

%p
  It is hoped that ANRW'22 will be a hybrid event with an in-person
  component co-locating with the IETF-114 meeting in Philadelphia, although
  this is contingent on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic and other
  circumstances – details will be confirmed nearer the time. Remote
  participation options will be available; please contact the chairs if you
  intend to submit work but know in advance that you will not be able to
  present the work in-person at the workshop.

%p
  ANRW'22 particularly encourages the submission of results that could
  form the basis for future engineering work in the IETF, by, for example
  providing input and analysis on Internet protocols or operational
  Internet practices, as well as influence further research and
  experimentation in the IRTF.
