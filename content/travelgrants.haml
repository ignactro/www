    post-PhD employment at a University);
  %li
    Can demonstrate engagement with research of relevance to the

%h2 Applied Networking Research Workshop Travel Grants

%p
  The 
  %a{ :href => "/anrw"} ACM/IRTF Applied Networking Research Workshop (ANRW)
  is an annual academic workshop that provides a forum for researchers,
  vendors, network operators, and the Internet standards community to
  present and discuss emerging results in applied networking research, and
  to find inspiration from topics and open problems discussed at the IETF.

%p
  A number of travel grants are available for students to attend the
  ANRW each year. The requirements, application process, and deadline
  vary slightly each year, so please see 
  %a{ :href => "/anrw"} the ANRW webpage
  for details of the current workshop and its travel grant programme.






%h2 Support to attend co-located IRTF and IETF meetings

%p
  Many IRTF Research Groups meet co-located with 
  %a{ :href => "https://ietf.org/how/meetings/"} IETF standards meetings.
  Registration for these meetings is handled by the IETF, and a single
  registration permits attendance at the IETF working groups and at any
  co-located IRTF research group meetings. The IETF offers a substantial
  discount on the registration fee for full-time students, and a discounted
  pass for one day attendance.

%j
  Live streaming and remote attendance at such meetings is also available.
  This is free of charge, but requires advance registration.

%p
  Details are provided on the
  %a{ :href => "https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/register/"} IETF Registration Page.

%p
  The IRTF has a limited number of complementary one day passes available
  to cover registration costs for those who would not otherwise be able to
  attend an IRTF research group meeting co-located with the IETF. Contact
  the 
  %a{ :href => "mailto:irtf-chair@irtf.org"} IRTF chair
  for details, explaining why you need such a pass, and stating what
  research group(s) you wish to attend, at what meeting, and what
  contribution you will make to the group.
