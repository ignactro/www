    %h2 Overview

    %p
      The
      %span.term Internet Research Task Force
      (IRTF) focuses on longer term research issues related to the Internet while the parallel organization, the
      %span.term Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF), focuses on the shorter term issues of engineering and standards making.

    %p
      The IRTF is a composed of a number of focused and long-term
      %span.term Research Groups.
      These groups work on topics related to Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology. Research Groups have the stable long term membership needed to promote the development of research collaboration and teamwork in exploring research issues.  Participation is by individual contributors, rather than by representatives of organizations.

    %p
      The IRTF is managed by the
      %span.term IRTF Chair
      in consultation with the
      %span.term Internet Research Steering Group
      (IRSG). The IRSG membership includes the IRTF Chair, the chairs of the various Research Groups and other individuals ("members at large") from the research community selected by the IRTF Chair.

    %p
      The RFC Editor publishes documents from the IRTF and its Research Groups on the
      %span.term IRTF Stream
      (RFC5743).

    %h2 More Information

    %p The detailed IRTF Research Group guidelines and procedures are described in RFC2014. In RFC4440, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) further details the role of the IRTF. RFC7418 provides an IRTF Primer for IETF Participants.

    %p The procedures for publishing documents on the IRTF RFC Stream are defined in RFC5743, with additional details found in RFC5742. The concept of RFC Streams is defined in RFC4844.

    %p
      The IRTF follows the IETF
      %a{ :href => "ipr" } Intellectual Property Rights
      (IPR) disclosure rules. Also see Section 3.2 of RFC5743.

    %p
      The
      %a{ :href => "https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-anti-harassment-policy/" } IETF Anti-Harassment Policy
      also applies to the IRTF.


    %h2 Active Research Groups

    %p These #{$rgs.count} Research Groups are currently chartered or proposed for chartering:

    %h2 Workshops and Prizes

    %p
      The 
      %a{ :href => "/anrw/"} ACM/IRTF Applied Networking Research Workshop
      is an academic workshop that provides a forum for researchers,
      vendors, network operators, and the Internet standards community to
      present and discuss emerging results in applied networking research.
      It co-locates with the summer IETF meeting each year.

    %p
      The 
      %a{ :href => "/anrp/"} Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP)
      is awarded for recent results in applied networking research that
      are relevant for transitioning into shipping Internet products and
      related standardization efforts. Nominations are made each Autumn,
      and prize winners give their award talks in the IRTF Open Meetings
      the following year.
