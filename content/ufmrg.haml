%p
  The process by which the IETF develops protocol standards is centred
  around production of documents written primarily in English prose. This
  facilitates discussion and consensus building, which are essential for
  the community to function, but the resulting documents suffer from the
  ambiguity of natural language and the inability to use automated tools to
  reason about, and validate, the specifications. The use of formal
  methods, including formal verification and analysis, can make
  specifications easier to validate against desired goals such as
  correctness and security and to define these goals. Formal verification
  in particular also supports automated tooling and reference code
  generation, but this approach is not yet widely used in the IETF
  community.

%p
  There are technical and non-technical reasons for the slow adoption of
  formal methods by the Internet standards community. Technical limitations
  include performance of the analysis tools which donâ€™t always allow to
  model or verify complex systems, the lack of support for specific kinds
  of proofs, and formalisms that may not be able to fully describe the
  complexity of modern protocols or the network environment. And, on the
  non-technical side, use of formal methods may require the use of
  unfamiliar protocol description languages and modelling tools, or assume
  familiarity with concepts that are not widely known by those writing
  RFCs. Further, there are questions around how such a shift in protocol
  design methodology would affect the collaborative social process by which
  consensus is built around the design of protocols.

%p
  The objectives of the Usable Formal Methods Research Group are to:

%ul
  %li
    Bring together the Internet protocol standards community and the
    academic research community studying formal methods of protocol
    specifications to share experience and ideas;

  %li
    Explore and understand the strengths and limitations of formal methods,
    including formal verification and analysis, for specification and
    implementation of algorithms, protocols, and systems specified in the
    IETF, and to understand how those techniques can be improved to better
    support such specifications;

  %li
    Understand how formal methods can be incorporated into the development
    of technical standards, and to explore how this may affect the
    development of technical specifications and the consensus building
    process;

  %li
    Produce resources such as educational material, for example formal
    analyses for existing IETF protocols, or open source software that can
    be used by the IETF to apply formal methods for improving technical
    specifications; and

  %li
    Encourage and support experimentation with formal methods in the
    context of IETF, to gain insight into the feasibility, applicability,
    and limitations of such methods when applied to protocol development in
    IETF, and document experiences and results from using formal methods
    for IETF work.

%p
  Examples of the types of formal protocol specification techniques to be
  considered include, but are not limited to, languages for specifying
  algorithms, analysis tools for specifying and validating protocols and
  systems, and tools and techniques to help derive formal models from
  natural language and semi-structured specifications. The group will
  consider formal methods, broadly defined, and their application to
  several targets, including algorithms, network protocols at all layers of
  the protocol stack (low-level internetworking, routing, and transport
  protocols; security protocols; cryptographic algorithms; and applications
  and APIs), and distributed systems that compose these protocols.

%p
  The group will work closely with other IRTF research groups, with the
  IETF standards development community, and with researchers developing
  formal methods for protocol specification. It will meet regularly
  co-located with both IETF meetings and with related academic conferences
  and workshops (e.g., Security Standardization Research (SSR),
  Computer-Aided Verification (CAV), etc.).

%p
  An explicit non-goal is to propose changes to the IETF standards process,
  the RFC format, or the Internet-draft authoring process. The research
  group may explore ideas that require such changes, and is uniquely placed
  to discuss their implications with the IETF community, but the potential
  incorporation of such ideas into the standards process is a matter for
  the IETF and is out of scope for this group.
