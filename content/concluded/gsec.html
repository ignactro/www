<P>The Group Security Research Group (GSEC) focuses on security issues of large 
and small groups that operate on networks, which may be running a bulk 
distribution method such as broadcast, multicast or anycast. GSEC investigates 
security topics that are emerging technologies and not ready for 
standardization, such as novel models for group policy management, scalability 
issues for large groups, access control, authorization, and security for 
multiple-source multicast groups. GSEC's focus is more general than multicast 
security and encompasses group membership management, key management, and policy 
management for groups of principals that may or may not use multicast 
communications. GSEC work includes the interaction between network protocols and 
security. GSEC's emphasis is on the stability and convergence of security 
protocols that operate among groups that have various distinct characteristics 
of group size, membership dynamics, topology, degree of interaction, latency 
requirements, centralized control, and bandwidth constraints. Examples areas of 
interest in GSEC are: 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Group Policy Management. Group Policy Management considers alternative 
  models of group control and the policy parameters that describe group 
  authorization. Groups can have a single locus of authorization as in the 
  Group-Owner/Group-Controller Model or coalitions of Group Owners, which may 
  operate across policy domains. Group policy management touches practically all 
  group-security technologies and may include so-called "traitor tracing" and 
  other technologies that detect when members violate group access-control 
  policies. 
  <LI>Decentralized Group Key Management. The design of fault tolerant protocols 
  that are robust in decentralized models of group key management. These models 
  do not use a single centralized KDC and are important for small, dynamic 
  groups (or coalitions) in a variety of applications such as small group 
  teleconferencing and fault-tolerant routing. 
  <LI>Security technologies for closed and open groups. Open groups are those 
  where non-members are allowed to communicate with the group. Such groups might 
  require a notion of a "group public key", for example. 
  <LI>Multiple Senders. Multiple-source groups have special requirements for 
  denial of service protection and for minimizing state needed for sender 
  authentication. 
  <LI>Group Key and Membership Management. New protocols to distribute a common 
  group key to all group members that exhibit differing properties of 
  scalability, processing requirements energy usage, storage, and inter-member 
  communications are part of the research agenda. These topics also include 
  membership management algorithms that manage access to group keying materials 
  and are especially relevant to emerging wireless applications. 
  <LI>Non-multicast security. Previous work has focused on application of group 
  security to multicast transport. New work that focuses on groups that use some 
  transport other than multicast, such as broadcast or anycast, is of interest. 
  This includes group key management for ad-hoc networking 
  <LI>Reliable Multicast. The relationship between secure multicast and reliable 
  multicast is not well understood. Additional research is required to clearly 
  articulate the reliability that can be assumed by security services, and the 
  security that can be provided to reliability services. </LI></OL>
<P>The goals of GSEC with respect to these areas of investigation include the 
following. 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Review of past and current work in each area; evaluation of the available 
  technologies and collaboration with those working in these areas. 
  <LI>Development of new technologies where needed and presentation at 
  appropriate conferences and gatherings 
  <LI>Identification of technologies that are ready for standardization in the 
  IETF </LI></UL>
<P>MEETINGS: Meetings are typically held concurrent with IETF meetings (three 
times a year) with special meetings being called on an as-needed basis. 
<P>MEMBERSHIP: The GSEC Research Group is an open IRTF RG. The meetings and 
mailing list are open to all participants. Participants are encouraged to be 
deeply knowledgeable of the literature and current technologies related to 
security, multicast, and group communications.
