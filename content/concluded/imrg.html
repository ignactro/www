<h3>Charter</h3>
<blockquote>
There is considerable network measurement work being conducted within the
Internet community -- both in standards bodies (e.g., IETF IPPM WG) and
in various research labs.  The goal of the Internet Measurement Research
Group (IMRG) is to provide a venue to: (1) provide a forum for discussion
of Internet measurement research issues, (2) aid in the coordination of
various research projects, (3) assess new measurement techniques, and (4)
increase interactions between operators, developers of measurement tools
and techniques, and researchers who analyze and model Internet dynamics.
The scope includes all kinds of network measurement (active techniques,
passive monitoring, end-point probing, in-network methods, network layer,
transport layer, application layer, etc.).  The RG will both attempt to
design new measurement techniques and analyze measurements of the network
taken.

The following represent examples of the types of projects that the RG
might undertake:

<ul>
  <p><li> Tackle outstanding issues dealing with measurement infrastructures
    (e.g., Surveyor, NIMI), such as: scalability of meshes, security of
    measurement tools in the mesh, access control, resource control,
    scheduling issues.

  <p><li> Tackle the often thorny issue of sharing measurement data within
    the community.  The RG could define a systematic way for storing
    measurements and any needed meta-data that should be kept with the
    measurements.  In addition, the RG could foster research into systems
    for remote requests for measurement, analysis, and anonymization,
    facilitating a formed of reduced access to data that cannot be
    directly released.

  <p><li> Provide a venue for assessing new measurement techniques, and a forum
    for sharing preliminary findings in rough form, to encourage further
    work and collaboration.

  <p><li> Provide a venue for developing models based on network measurements,
    helping to better understand network dynamics and aiding researchers
    attempting to conduct useful simulations of the network.

  <p><li> Foster communication between the research and operations communities.
    For example, operators could provide feedback to researchers as to
    what sorts of network properties/characteristics they would like to see
    measured, and how well current techniques work.

  <p><li> Catalog core problems that need to be addressed.  Even if the RG is
    not actively working on these problems, having a "wish list" of
    outstanding problems may foster work in these areas.

</ul>

Coordination - the RG will provide:

<ul>
    
  <p><li> A venue for exploring measurement techniques before they are ready
    to be standardized by the IETF (in IPPM, for instance).

  <p><li> A venue for discussing real world experience with IETF defined metrics
    and measurement techniques.

  <p><li> A "measurement arm" to various IETF working groups to gain a better
    understanding of how protocols work in the wild (e.g., which HTTP
    capabilities are being implemented or the performance of the global
    DNS system).

</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Membership</h3>
<blockquote>
The RG operates in an open fashion (meetings & mailing list).  In some
cases, closed "design teams" may be used to accomplish work items that would
significantly benefit from a smaller group of people, or work items that
cannot be accomplished in an open group (e.g., due to data sharing issues).
The status of any closed activities the RG undertakes shall be reported
to the entire RG periodically.
</blockquote>

<h3>Meetings</h3>
<blockquote>
Meetings will be held 2-3 times a year -- sometimes co-located with other
events (e.g., IETF meetings, conferences, etc.) and sometimes independently.
