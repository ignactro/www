<b>Charter</b>
<blockquote>
A number of events and technology requirements explored over the last
several years serve to remind us that the DNS functions well as the
Internet's system for assigning static textual identifiers to host
resources, but functions poorly as a set of user-visible names.  Most
recently, internationalization issues -- the inherent ambiguity of
natural language, problems working with Unicode in an environment that
requires exact-match lookups, user desire for convenient, natural
language names, the impact of trademark law, etc. -- have highlighted
this distinction.  It can also be argued that an entirely different
system of identifiers intended for human use is needed in addition to
a system that is designed to work well for protocol elements, such as
URIs.
<p>
This research group is chartered to examine the issues outlined above
and determine whether there is a tractable problem that can be solved,
and needs to be solved with additional engineering standards.  If there
is, the research group will define and explain that problem to the
extent needed to determine whether a layered and faceted search approach
as described in the input documents being considered by the research
group, or some lookup approach different from the DNS, or some other
approach, represent directions the IETF should pursue, and will make
recommendations to that effect.
<p>
Some specific questions, as examples:
<ul>
<li> There has been recent interest in solutions that involve injecting
one or more layers of directory-like search (using qualified natural
language strings rather than names) between user-level code/protocols
and the DNS.  Is the categorization of "above DNS" systems described
in the research group's input documents (i.e., a global faceted
directory supplemented by localized yellow-pages-like systems) an
appropriate one, or are other structures more appropriate?
<p>
<li> Is the model of matching represented by the IETF string preparation
(stringprep) [1] and name preparation (nameprep) [2] protocols
appropriate for "above DNS" systems, or is additional work needed?
<p>
<li> draft-klensin-dns-search [3], and other documents, include the
assumption that a centralized name-allocating authority is undesirable and
unnecessary.  Is that assumption reasonable, and, if so, what models are
plausible for locating servers and navigating among them?  If the assumption
is not reasonable, the research group will document why not, and explore
the implications of centralized name-allocating authorities.
<p>
<li> Much of the work that has been characterized as "maintaining a
clear separation between the structure of DNS names and the
complexities of internationalization issues" has been struggling to
find a home and definition in the IETF.  What specific elements of that
work, or of internationalization work more generally, are required to
make progress on DNS alternatives for resource location by users?
</ul>
<p>
The output of this research group will be usable by the IETF or other
standards bodies if this effort demonstrates that there is
standardization work to be done.  The solution space for this research
group must be within the scope of the IETF's core competencies.
<p>
The research group is expected to be small and very focused.  It
operates in a closed fashion, and membership is by invitation.
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<b>Milestones</b>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li> Develop a glossary and problem statement that defines what is and
isn't in scope within the broader confines of this charter.  This
includes analysis of things like "just what exactly is needed in
different user communities to be able to do correct matches".  It also
includes analysis of the spectrum between exact match, ASCII lookup,
and natural language search and where the intersections are.
<p>
<li> Solicit papers or proposals to address the problem statement(s) in 1)
and then create an analysis of those proposed solutions.
<p>
<li> Delivery of the solution set(s), if any.
</ul>
