The relying party may have receivedthe identified party's public key through a trusted communication, orthe identified party may trust a third party to do validate the  identified party's public key.</p><p>Public keys are typically carried in signed objects called"certificates". A certificate may be signed by the identified party(in which case it is called a "self-signed certificate"), or it maybe signed by a third party (often called a "certificate authority").Certificates typically include metadata about the public key,metadata about the identity of the identified party, and metadata  about the signature on the certificate.</p><p>There are many formats for certificates, although by far the mostcommonly-used one on the Internet today is described in RFC 5280,commonly called "PKIX". The PKIX certificate format describes abits-on-the-wire representation of information as well as the  semantics associated with the information.</p><p>Separate from the certificate format, public key cryptography usuallyinvolves many protocols and additional message formats, togethercalled a public key infrastructure ("PKI"). A PKI typically includesat least a mechanism for a third party to indicate to a relying partythat a certificate has been revoked, as well as a way for anidentified party to ask a certification authority to create a  certificate with particular metadata.</p><p>PKIX was designed and initially deployed before there were many userson the Internet. Some of the underlying concepts from which PKIX wasdeveloped assume a single universal database (a global X.500directory that never came to pass) as well as a strong role forpublic certificate-issuing authorities. While those concepts, and thePKIX certificate semantics, have translated into current deployment,they have often limited applications that rely on the PKIX standardsin what kinds of certificates and infrastructure those applicationscan use. Current best practice for most Internet protocols is to basetheir use of public key cryptography on PKIX. This RG is notquestioning that position, but rather is looking ahead to a nextgeneration of support for the use of public key cryptography inInternet protocols.</p><h3>Charter</h3><p>The PK Next Generation (PKNG) Research Group will look into alternatecertificate formats, semantics, and PK services that couldeventually replace PKIX if deployed. The PKNG design work will befrom the perspective of maximizing utility for the relying party andthe identified party; issues of what would be best for a certificateauthorities will be given much less priority, and the features list  will be developed before format and protocol specifics are discussed.</p><p>Given this perspective, the design work will need to take intoaccount how users could transition from PKIX to an eventual new PKI.Different design decisions could make this transition more or lesseasy, and such decisions need to be explicitly laid out. Designing aPKI that would be nearly impossible to use by current PKIX userswould not be a useful output from the PKNG RG.<p><p>The PKNG RG will first develop a detailed list of desired featuresfor a next-generation PKI. The resulting list will explicitly excludethe format for certificates or the design of protocols to meet thedesired features. It will deal with a wide range of public key issuesincluding for example trust anchors, enrollment, revocation, andsemantics of the states in the certificate lifecycle. It is hopedthat the RG can agree to one list, but if there is sufficientinterest in having multiple lists, they will be permitted as long aseach list gets significant review from the RG as a whole. Because ofthe research needed for the creation of this list or lists, this isexpected to be a multi-year task.<p><p>After the feature list is created, the PKNG RG will develop one ormore experimental instantiations of PKIs based on the desiredfeatures. This development will include extensive evaluation of howdifferent formats, semantics, and protocols meet the desiredfeatures, particularly the requirement for a sensible transition fromPKIX to the new format and protocols.  The PKNG RG may developproposals as input to the IETF for standardization, but that is not aprimary goal of this research.<p><p>The research challenges expected to be faced by the PKNG RG includedevising a taxonomy for PKI that is based on maximal utility for awide variety of users; avoiding features whose genesis derive fromthe semantics of PKIX rather than the general use cases for publickeys; issues of privacy and identification in certificates; anddetermining how to evaluate differences in transition strategiesgiven that such a transition has never taken place on the Internet.The IRTF is more amenable to this type of research than, say, theIETF, where a single "requirements document" would be expected to befinished in a short period of time and a single protocol would beexpected to emerge by group consensus.</p><h3>Membership</h3><p>The PKNG RG is open to any interested parties who intend to remain  current with the published documents and mailing list issues.</p><h3>Meetings</h3><p>The PKNG RG will meet face-to-face approximately twice a year. Once ayear, it would meet as part of the IETF; the other meeting would beco-resident with other meetings that active RG participants would beattending anyway, such as research and academic conferences on the  topic of PKI, trust, and authentication.</p>				       </div>        </td>      </tr>    </table>    <!-- end of page content -->      </div><script type="text/javascript">var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
