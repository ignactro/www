  <H3>Charter</H3>

  <P>In the original Internet end-to-end architecture, a transport
  connection linked a pair of hosts and was bound to a globally
  unique IP address and locally meaningful transport port at each
  end host. This architecture has been progressively eroded, most
  notably by the use of NATs, which modify addresses, and firewalls
  and other middle boxes, which expect to understand the semantics
  behind any given port number (for instance to block or
  differentially handle a flow). As a result, end hosts are often
  not able to connect even when security policies would otherwise
  allow such connections. This problem will only be exacerbated
  with the emerging need for IPv4-IPv6 translation. Beyond this,
  other changes in the way the Internet is used has stressed the
  original unique-address:port model of transport connections. For
  instance, the need for robustness has resulted in a rise in
  multi-homing, which has led to scaling issues in BGP. The use of
  multiple addresses at hosts is known to alleviate this problem,
  but the architecture provides no good way to manage multiple
  addresses, either at connection establishment or when the active
  address has to be changed. Mobility across access networks
  similarly results in the need to cope with changing IP addresses
  during a connection. In addition, DoS attacks are increasingly a
  concern. There is a need for hosts to be able to control which
  other hosts can send packets to it, and to exercise that control
  deep in the network (i.e. near the attacker).</P>

  <P>The common roots of this seemingly diverse set of problems are
  the following:</P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
      <LI>The IP address is no longer globally unique, is no longer
      intact end-to-end, and is no longer stable over even short
      time periods.</LI>

      <LI>The transport port number has no clear semantics outside
      of the end-host that opened the socket.</LI>

      <LI>End hosts are often not explicitly aware of middle boxes,
      especially middle boxes far away from them, and therefore
      cannot control them much less be aware of what they are
      doing.</LI>
    </UL>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>Beyond the specific problems mentioned above, this erosion of
  the original E2E Internet mechanisms broadly results in greater
  application-level complexity (to cope with the erosion), network
  fragility and lack of robustness, poor security, and difficulty
  in debugging the resulting problems.</P>

  <P>While this group is not the first to identify these problems,
  we do recognize that there may be a single architectural
  enhancement that solves them all. Namely, a higher-level
  DNS-based naming scheme (i.e. URIs) coupled with signaling
  protocols used to initiate and modify transport-level connections
  such as TCP, UDP, SCTP or DCCP flows. Such a protocol could
  provide a way for end-to-end communication to explicitly address
  middleboxes, so that their behavior can be understood, monitored
  and controlled. Such a protocol might also be used to move
  connections between IP addresses, as with mobility and
  multihoming, and to shut down unwanted communication, as with DoS
  attacks.</P>

  <P>The goal of the End-Middle-End Research Group (EME) is to
  evaluate the feasibility and desirability of such an
  architectural change to the Internet. The aim is first to
  investigate possible designs for a strawman experimental protocol
  that can perform these tasks (the so-called "ideal" design)
  without being overly constrained by overlapping work happening in
  the IETF and elsewhere. Should one or more designs appear viable,
  then issues such as related work and incremental deployment
  should be considered. Should this work still appear viable, then
  the IESG will be consulted with regards to whether and how this
  should be brought into the IETF for standardization.</P>

  <P>There are many questions that need to be answered along the
  way. These issues include precisely which architectural problems
  should be tackled and which should not, the degree to which such
  signaling should be on-path vs off- path and the balance between
  flexibility vs simplicity and efficiency. There are clear
  concerns about such a track that need to be evaluated. Candidate
  protocols should avoid falling into the virtual circuit trap,
  where routers lose the ability to remedy failures locally, and
  avoid building a mechanism that encourages the construction of
  walled gardens to the detriment of the Internet as a whole.</P>

  <H3>Milestones</H3>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
      <LI>Applicability Statement. This document would investigate
      possible architectural issues that resemble those described
      above, where there is a need to signal between end-systems
      and entities logically in the middle of the network, or where
      connections need to be bound between more than two IP
      addresses.</LI>

      <LI>Design Choices Document. This document would describe the
      design choices available, so as on-path vs off-path options,
      signal encoding, and naming and addressing issues, both for
      end-systems and middleboxes.</LI>

      <LI>Strawman Experimental Protocol Design.</LI>

      <LI>A series of documents describing how the strawman
      protocol might be used to address specific architectural
      issues.</LI>

      <LI>Incremental deployment plan. A document describing the
      obstacles that would be faced deploying the strawman
      protocol, and how these issues might be addressed.</LI>

      <LI>One or more reference implementations of the strawman
      protocol.</LI>
    </UL>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>It is envisaged that the first three will be worked on
  simultaneously, with (4) through (6) following later as the
  strawman protocol solidifies.</P>

  <H3>Process</H3>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    Meetings will be held as needed, but no less than once per
    year, and no more than three per year.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <H3>Membership Policy</H3>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    The RG operates in an open fashion (meetings &amp; mailing
    list). In some cases, closed "design teams" may be used to
    accomplish work items that would significantly benefit from a
    smaller group of people, or work items that cannot be
    accomplished in an open group (e.g., due to data sharing
    issues). The status of any closed activities the RG undertakes
    shall be reported to the entire RG periodically.
